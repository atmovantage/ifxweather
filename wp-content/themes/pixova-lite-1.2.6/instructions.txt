Q: How can I set-up the blog page ?
A: Go to Pages -> Add new. Create a new page (this page will also be the URL where your blog will be housed; we recommend creating a page named Blog). Select the 'Blog Template' on the right hand side (don't enter any text in this page). Click Save & you can now point your browser
 to www.yoursite.com/blog/ - this is where your blog archive will be housed.

Q: Do I also have to set-up the permalinks in any special way so that the theme looks like in the demo ?
A: No, in this version you can use any permalink setting you want.

Q: How can I set-up the menu like in the demo ?
A: If there is no menu set, there's a fallback menu. The sections available for this version of the theme are: About, Works, Testimonials, Team, Contact. For each of these sections, you should create a menu entry with the following link structure:
    www.yoursiteurl/#about
    www.yoursiteurl/#works
    www.yoursiteurl/#testimonials
    www.yoursiteurl/#team
    www.yoursiteurl/#contact

Simply go to Appearance -> Menus -> Create a new menu. After you've created your new menu, locate, on the left side, the "custom link option". Proceed to add the links to the menu with the above link structure(#about, #works, #testimonials, #team & #contact). The labels for these links are at your own choosing,
only the link destination has to be as detailed above.
